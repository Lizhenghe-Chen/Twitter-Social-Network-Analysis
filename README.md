# Twitter-Social-Network-Analysis
Using NetworkX to analyze Twitter Social Network

If you like to build your own Twitter network (and manage to get developer access to Twitter API below) use the following instructions:

In order to be able to download Twitter data you have to sign up first for Twitter (if you do not have an account already) and then apply for a developer API access at
https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access
Select Research / Education as the purpose and say in the description: “I am a student at the University of Liverpool taking Big Data Analytics module. I would like to get developer access to Twitter API to do a partial analysis of a small fragment of Twitter network to establish what kind of network it is (scale-free, random etc.).”
and in the analysis part: “I would like to get developer access to Twitter API to do a partial analysis of a small fragment of Twitter network to establish what kind of network it is (scale-free, random etc.).” Just select Yes in “Analyze Twitter data” and No elsewhere. More detailed instruction with (a bit outdated) screenshots on CANVAS (Learning Resources). 

In order to retrieve data from Twitter you should first read the following guides:
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-download-and-visualize-your-twitter-network-f009dbbf107b
and/or
pages 64-68 and 79-82 of Data Science and Complex Networks book (check Learning Resources on CANVAS). Example Python code will also appear there.

Otherwise, you can simply download one of the social networks available at:

For instance you can use:
